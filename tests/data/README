nohrio test data info
=======================

All data copied from Vikings of Midgard (found @ 'vikings.rpgdir' in the wip branch of ohrrpgce SVN):

   svn://gilgamesh.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/wip

This is a partial copy -- some files are omitted, which means this
is NOT a functioning .rpgdir that you could play with OHRRPGCE game player.
Check out the below if you want a playable copy.

As a OHRRPGCE user you should already know about Vikings of Midgard, but
if you don't,
