nohrio
======

nohrio is a project designed to facilitate OHRRPGCE data manipulation utilities and 
human inspection of data, by providing:

a ) numpy.memmap based interface for directly manipulating OHRRPGCE fixed-length-record based data files. 

b) a human readable and editable YAML serialization of all records, upon which standard tools like 'grep' and 'diff' are applicable

c) sane, readily updateable binary serialization of the insane-in-spots OHRRPGCE formats


OHRRPGCE: http://gilgamesh.hamsterrepublic.com/wiki/ohrrpgce/index.php/Main_Page

Requires NumPy and PyYAML.
For building docs, requires Sphinx, SCons, and PyLit

old README
---------------

This is the OHRRPGCE I/O module, extracted from the depths of my misc doctests module
so I could.. do *unit*-testing on them :)
It handles OHRRPGCE data formats directly and can easily be used to make mass changes like cleaning strings.
Simple formats are already YAML serializable

Next is to test the robustness of that implementation, then to support more complex formats.
