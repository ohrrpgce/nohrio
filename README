This is the OHRRPGCE I/O module, extracted from the depths of my misc doctests module
so I could.. do *unit*-testing on them :)
It handles OHRRPGCE data formats directly and can easily be used to make mass changes like cleaning strings.
Simple formats are already YAML serializable

Next is to test the robustness of that implementation, then to support more complex formats.
