nohrio
======

nohrio is a project designed to facilitate OHRRPGCE data manipulation utilities and 
human inspection of data, by providing:

a ) numpy.memmap based interface for directly manipulating OHRRPGCE fixed-length-record based data files. 

b) a human readable and editable YAML serialization of all records, upon which standard tools like 'grep' and 'diff' are applicable

c) sane, readily updateable binary serialization of the insane-in-spots OHRRPGCE formats


OHRRPGCE: http://gilgamesh.hamsterrepublic.com/wiki/ohrrpgce/index.php/Main_Page

Requires NumPy and PyYAML.
For building docs, requires Sphinx, SCons, and PyLit

James Paige : 
  Created the OHRRPGCE, through which I have learnt a surprising amount about fileformats.
  James would tell you not to use it as an example! And I would agree -- 
  it's a better counterexample. James is also a really nice guy.

Fenrir-Lunaris : 
  Created Vikings of Midgard, for which part of it's aim is to show off features.
  Gave me permission to use VoM lumps for my test suite, for which they are ideal for aforementioned
  reasons (And well, I like the game). 
  Also an artistic inspiration, as both an example and counter-example.

Myself : 
  Wrote quite a few utilities for OHRRPGCE, and made the new master palette for it
  with a good deal of research and experimentation. Without those I would never have made these, 
  this is a total paradigm shift (my old utilities were written when OHR ran on DOS :)

A vast array of XML-abusers:
  Tremendously effective counter-examples. XML is not a Data Language, it's a Markup Language!
