------------------

Of course, if you haven't done so yet, do 'import this'; all of those apply here! :)

Further:

* Given the choice between tolerably stupid behaviour and clever behaviour, choose stupid.
  The difference between the two is in code-path straightforwardness; When something
  goes wrong with stupid code, it tends to be obvious. When something goes wrong with
  clever code, it tends to seem arcane. Reject all non-trivial automagic.
* Code review. Don't try to hide your mistakes, or present only 'finished' code
  (as if there is such a thing.)
